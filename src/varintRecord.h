/* ====================================================================
 * varintRecord — Schema-Driven Columnar Record Compression
 * ====================================================================
 * Compresses arrays of fixed-stride C records (structs) by describing
 * their layout with a runtime field-descriptor table. Encode gathers
 * each field across all records into a column and hands that column to
 * every compression strategy its kind supports; the strategies are
 * measured against each other and the smallest wins, per column, with
 * the winner recorded on the wire. The strategy lanes cover the whole
 * framework:
 *
 *   COMPETE   normalized u64 column through varintCompete's chunked
 *             per-block competition (tagged, delta, delta-of-delta,
 *             stride, FOR, PFOR, dict, RLE, BP128, BP128-delta,
 *             palette, palette-delta, Elias gamma/delta)
 *   XOR       XOR-with-previous transform, then COMPETE — consecutive
 *             similar floats cancel sign/exponent/high-mantissa bits,
 *             so smooth float columns become small-integer columns
 *   FLOAT     varintFloat lossless stream (sign/exponent/mantissa
 *             planes with three exponent-coding modes, all measured)
 *   PLANES    byte-plane decomposition: byte position p of every value
 *             becomes its own 0-255 column through COMPETE — captures
 *             per-position structure in opaque bytes and wide integers
 *   DD_STREAM varintDDStream lossless stream for 106-bit double-double
 *             fields (gap-coded trailing limbs, XOR-chained leading)
 *   VERBATIM  raw column bytes — the floor that guarantees a column
 *             never expands beyond its raw size plus tag overhead
 *
 * Lossy-risk lanes (FLOAT, DD_STREAM) are verified by decode before
 * they are allowed to win: if the round trip is not bit-exact for this
 * data, the lane is discarded and the next-best measured lane ships.
 * Every emitted stream therefore decodes to byte-identical records.
 *
 * The schema travels inside the stream: the decoder reconstructs the
 * records from the bytes alone, with no external metadata. Schemas are
 * plain C descriptor arrays — offsetof/sizeof capture the struct layout
 * with compile-time correctness.
 *
 * Stream format (all multi-byte scalars are tagged varints):
 *   [magic:4 = 'V' 'R' 'E' 'C'][version:1]
 *   [recordCount][recordSize][fieldCount]
 *   fieldCount x [kind:1][flags:1][offset][size]      (the schema)
 *   fieldCount x [strategy:1][columnBytes][payload]   (the columns)
 * PLANES payloads hold size x [planeBytes][chunked-compete stream].
 *
 * Field bytes are extracted per the declared endianness (little-endian
 * unless VARINT_RECORD_FLAG_BIG_ENDIAN), so wire-format records
 * round-trip bit-exactly on any host. Signed kinds are sign-extended
 * and ZigZag-mapped before competition so small negatives stay small.
 * BOOL fields are validated to hold only 0/1 at encode time. Record
 * bytes not covered by any field (padding, ignored regions) are not
 * stored; decode zero-fills them. */
